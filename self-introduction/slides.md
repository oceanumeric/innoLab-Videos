* ## The team is not working cohesively
* ## We made some small money but not enough to support the team financially

# But reality should be harsh

Common questions I encountered:

* > XXX firms are doing the same thing, why do you think you can do better?

* > You are not the first one who has this idea, why do you think you can succeed?

* > Who will pay for your product or service?

# Those questions are indeed legitimate! 

* ## Why the reality should be and is harsh?
* ## I will explain why those questions are legitimate
* ## I will use two real life examples to illustrate
    * ### Things I wish I knew before I started my startup
    * ### Things I will stick to no matter what I do in the future
