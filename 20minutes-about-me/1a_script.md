Hello everyone,

I am recording this video called '20 minutes about me' as a series of videos to share my experiences. 

The reason I am doing this is to let potential collaborators, investors, and recruiters know more about me. I believe it is important to know a person's value, expertise, and vision before deciding to work with them.


In this video, I will share my experiences for doing startups and freelancing. I will share what I have learned from my experiences and how those experiences have shaped me as a person. Some of reflections might be useful for you, so I hope you enjoy this video.


When I tried to be an entrepreneur, I failed a lot of times. But I have also learned a lot from those failures.


After ChatGPT was realeased, I started to build up different applications with it. The first one I did is 'AI-Watcher'. I remember I was so excited when I finished it. I thought many people will use it. But it turned out that only a few people used it. In the end, It failed. Now I look back, I think the reason it failed is that I didn't do enough research on the market. The project itself is more like a toy project. 


After this toy project, I developed the second application called 'beprepared.studio'. This app is to help people to match their resumes with job descriptions. This one failed too. Some people give me good feedback, but most of them didn't use it. I also didn't promote it well. 

Beprepared studio is more like an dynamic web application and it is more complex than AI-Watcher. I mainly use fastapi as the backend and svelte as the frontend. 


Later, I got a freelance project from a company called 'Just Experts'. This firm is a consulting company that provides services to other companies. I was responsible for using large scale web scrapping and big data analaysis to help a printing firm to gain more customers.

Based on my analysis, a online publishing company called 'Bookkitchen' was founded to help influencers to publish their books. 


I consider this project as a success. I mainly use python, R and docker to deliver the project. 


Based on this experience, I developed a small application called 'AI-powered company search'. This app is to help people to find potential customers for their business. I like the app, and sometimes I also use it. I consider this project as a success too but with 50% discount.

I used openai's api, fastapi and svelte to build this app.


Why this project is only 50% success? First of all, I got some attention from the market. For instance, a guy called mingxi contacted me on LinkedIn and asked me to schedule a meeting. Later I learned he is the CEO of TigerGraph. Since I also shared my product on the youtube channel, some people also contacted me there and asked me how I built the app.


I think when we start our own business, we always wish or expect that our business will be successful. But the reality is that most of the businesses will fail. But gaining experience from those failures is the most important thing.


Also, during developing those applications, I improved my skills in many technologies. 

I also learned that technology itself is not enough. If you did not do enough research on the market, your project could become a debt. 


The another thing I want to emphasize is that never lie in the business world and never exaggerate your achievements. If you do, you will lose your credibility. Overall, it is a very small world. People will know you.

For those who do lie or exaggerate, they are wasting people's time and social resources. They are also wasting their own time.
