Now, I want to share some strategic thinking and reflections


If you check some videos, or go to attend some startup workshops, you might have seen this kind of image, which tells you that to have a successful startup, you need to have ideas, goals, build up teams, and then do research on market and consider many other factors. Then you will have a successful startup.

But in my opinion, this image is not correct. I will tell you why.


When I started my first startup, I thought I noticed some problems or
opportunities that I can solve or explore. Then I told myself, Look at there are some demands in the market and I can provide some solutions,
products or services to it simply because I can.

Supply mathes demand, then I should make lots of money. Unfortunately, things are not that simple. 


When you try to solve a problem, you need to employ human resources,
you need to spend some time on it, you also of course need financial resources. 

For every kind of resource, you have to think about its ooportunity cost. For instance, the time you spend on your project, you could spend it on other things, such as walking with your dog, or playing guitar, or having a date with your girlfriend.

For the human resources, you have to think about the opportunity cost of the people you hire. She or he could work for other companies, or she or he could start her or his own business.

This is also true for the financial resources. 


Therefore, one has to appreciate the opportunity cost of every resource. To put it into nutshell, all projects compete for resources.

So for every resource you want to use, you have to offer a competing price, which means it has to be better than the second best alternative.


Because building up new things costs a lot of resources, it is very important to think about who will pay for it. What I have learned is that entrepreneurs have to offer much better or cheaper solutions or products for the market. Otherwise, the market will not accept it.


This leads us to this reflection: the existence of unexploited 
opportunities does not imply any inefficiency at all. In market, one should assume that every resource stays at its best place without
disrupting forces. 


Therefore, I realized that the key to entrepreneurial success is to possess sufficient judegment to recognize true opportunities and to
screen out false ones. But having sufficient judgement is rare and only top entrepreneurs have this kind of ability.

If one is not talented to do that, we can let market help us to screen out false ones. But how? The answer is simple: let the market decide. 

Like my friend Daniel told me, 'Sell first, think and build later.' This is the best way to let the market decide. If you can sell your product, then you can build it. Otherwise, you should not waste your time and resources on it.

Okay, this is the end of my sharing. I hope you can learn something from it. Thank you for listening.
