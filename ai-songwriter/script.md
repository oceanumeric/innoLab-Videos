# Script for my video

## Slide 1

Hello, friends. My name is Michael and I am a machine learning engineer. Today I want to discuss with you the topic of AI songwriting. I want to test 
the ChatGPT's ability to write a song by compare it with a song that I wrote.

This is also a good case study to learn about prompt engineering, such as 'Few-shot learning' and 'Zero-shot learning'.


## Slide 2

Here is the roadmap. First we will listen to the song I wrote. If you found
it terrible, you can stop the video and leave. Otherwise, I will
explain to you how I wrote it.

To have a fair comparison, I will use the same information and situation to
write a new song with ChatGPT. Then we will compare the two songs and learn
what is prompt engineering.


## Slide 3

Okay, now let's listen to the song I wrote. 


## Slide 11

Thank you for listening. I hope you like it. Now let's move on to the next
part. I will explain how I wrote it.

It's the Thursday morning. I need to travel to another city for a meeting. I
went the train station but when I arrived, I found that the train was
cancelled because Deutche Bahn was on strike.

As you can see the newspage. 


## Slide 13

This situation gives me some nudge to write a song. But no one could
write a song out of nothing. We need reference. For me, my reference is
Bob Dylan's song. I like his song and I want to write a song like him.


## Slide 14

Let's have a look at one of Bob Dylan's song. It is called 'I want you'.
One part of the lyrics is like this.

The durnken politician leaps
upon the street where mothers weep

You can see the has rhyme and rhythm. It is simple but powerful. It 
also shows the political situation of that time, which is about the
Vietnam war and income inequality.



## Slide 15

Let's another example. This one is called 'It's all over now, baby blue'.

Here is one part of the lyrics.

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence


## Slide 16

I like this part because it fits with the scientific spirit. It is about
how important of luck in success. 

For instance, this is an article from scientific american. It says that
the role of luck in life success is far greater than we realized.


## Slide 17

So, I like Bob Dylan because his tone, dictions, rhyme and rhythm. Like 
Bob Dylan said by himsef, I live like a poet and I'll die like a poet.
That's part of my dream too. 


## Slide 18

Hopefully, I will not become a poor poet.


## Slide 19

At the same time, I was listening to the The Kinks

They have a song called 'Apeman' and part of the lyrics is like this.

'I don't feel safe in this world no more and 
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
just I want to sail away to a distant shore 
and make like an apeman'


## Slide 20

Later I was trying to learn this song with my guitar. It is a simple song
with three chords: A, E, and D


## Slide 21

During practcing, I got the inspiration. Then we have the song
I have just played for you with some lyrics like borrowed from
the Kinks but with Bob Dylan's tone and diction.


## Slide 22

Now, let's test the ChatGPT's ability to write a song. I will use the same
information and situation to see what kind of song it will write.

First, we will try to do it with no prompt. Then we will try to do it with
a prompt. Finally, we will try to do it with well-designed prompt, which
is called 'few-shot learning'. 


## Slide 23

This is the result without no prompt as you can see it 
gives a song with Bob Dylan's tone and diction. But it is does not
reflect the situation I was in.


## Slide 24

Now, we will try to use a prompt. The prompt is like this. Basically, it
gives several songs that I got the inspiration from. It also gives the
part of the lyrics from Bob Dylan's song. 


## Slide 25

Here is the result. It is better than the previous one. It gives a song
that has a very similar style that I used in the examples from Bob Dylan's
song. But it is still not good enough. It does not reflect the situation
I was in.


## Slide 26

Now, we will try to use a well-designed prompt. It is called 'few-shot
learning'. The idea is to give the model some examples and let it learn
from the examples and also give some information about the situation that
will make the model to be aware of the situation.

Here is the prompt, first I used some examples. 


## Slide 27

Then I give some information about the situation, mainly about the strike
and other news that I got from the newspaper that could show how I be
aware of the situation.


## Slide 28

For instance, I gave this news as an example. The title is called
'Who is in charge of Europe?'. If you are also aware of the situation, you
know what it means.


## Slide 29

I also gave the news about the strike.


## Slide 30

and one article from foreign affairs, called 
'Victory Is Ukraineâ€™s Only True Path to Peace'


## Slide 31

Then I gave the instruction and let the model to write a song for me
with the same style of Bob Dylan and lyrics that are borrowed from
the Kinks but with the situation I was in.


## Slide 32

Here is the result. It is getting better. I like this part:

farmers block the roads, in protest they stand tall
in this shifting landscape, where the poweful take a fall

This song was created with four chords: G, C, Em, and D. Since
it has the same chords like 'The Times They Are a-Changin', that's 
why ChatGPT gives the lyrics like this, which is very similar to
the lyrics from 'The Times They Are a-Changin'.


## Slide 33

Interestingly, ChatGPT gives different lyrics when I told it to write
a song with the chords I used in the song I wrote, the chord A, E, and D.

Here is the result. It is about the situation I was in but 
they did not show my reflection on the situation.

Also with this lyrics, you need to create the melody for it, which I 
have no idea how to do it. I alway create mdelody with my guitar and 
lyrics come out of it naturally.


## Slide 34


Here is the links to the ChatGPT posts I used to write the song.


## Slide 35

Who do you think win the contest? Please let me know in the comment. 

I think it should be me as ChatGPT still could not play guitar now.
