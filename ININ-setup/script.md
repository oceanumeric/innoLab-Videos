# ININ Setup Tutorial Script

Welcome everyone. My name is Fei Wang, you can also call my English name Michael. Currently, I am working as a research assistant in the Economic Department of Geothe University Frankfurt. My research interest is in the field of using machine learning 
and natural language processing to understand innovation and economic mechanism. 

This is my third year of giving this tutorial. I am very happy to see you all here. 
In this video, I will show you what you can expect from our tutorials and lab
training, and then I will guide you through the setup of the tutorial environment.


# What to expect from the tutorial

We are living in a transition period where the digital transformation and AI technology are reshaping the world. Those who have already tried ChatGPT might have a sense of how powerful AI can be. For those who have not, don't worry, you will have a chance to experience it in our tutorial.

When you are using ChatGPT, you probably have to copy and paste lots of text and move the content around. This is not very efficient. In our tutorial, we will use Github Copilot, which is a plugin that can generate text and code for you. It is like having a pair writer and coder with you.


We are using this technology to help you to write some code and text in our tutorial. Since not everyone in our class knows how to do coding with Python or R, I think this tool will be very helpful for you.


After getting familar with this tool, we will go through 5 lab sessions. In each session, we will cover a different topic. The topics are:

Lab 0 is designed to make you to get to know Github, Jupyter, Python and R
This is a lab where you will learn how to use Github, Jupyter, Python and R.
Most of time, you just need to run the code that I have written for you.
The theme of the lab is about Drama of Love.

In lab 1, we will tnter the world of Patents. This is a lab where you will learn how to query patents from the EPO Linked Open Data. You will learn the basic structure of a patent document, such as title, abstract, claims, and description, etc. You will learn how patent could help us to understand the technology landscape, such as the technology trend of electric vehicles and AI.

In lab 2, we will do more analysis on patents. The goal of this lab is to make you
become a pro in patent data analysis.  

In lab 3, we will learn how to do regression analysis.

In lab 4, We will use a dataset from a published paper to understand the relationship between innovation and institutions. After this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use data to answer research questions.

In our final lab, we will learn how to write a research paper. We will learn how to use Copilot to create a presentation and write a paper.
You will also learn how to use Latex to manage your references and write a paper with very professional format.


As you can see, we designed the tutorial to be very practical and hands-on. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a good understanding on the following topics:

- How to use Github Copilot to write code and text
- How to use SPARQL to query patents data
- How to do basic statistical analysis on patents data
- How to do basic regression analysis and interpret the results
- How to write a research paper using ChatGPT, Copilot, and Overleaf

We hope this tutorial will prepare you well for your future research and work. 


# Lab environment setup

Before we start the tutorial, we need to set up the lab environment. The lab environment will use Github Respository to store the tutorial materials, and we will use Jupyter Notebook to run the code.

To set up the lab environment, you need to follow the following steps:

1. first, register a Github account with your university email address. This step is very important as only university email address will give you access to Github Copilot.

2. After registering the account, you need to active Github Copilot. 

3. Once you have done the above steps, you can go to our tutorial repository and click 'use this template' to create your own repository.

That's it. Once you have done the above steps, you are ready to start the tutorial.

I highly recommend you to finish the lab environment setup before the tutorial starts.
Hope you are excited about the tutorial. I will see you in the first lab session.
