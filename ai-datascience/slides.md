# My journey

- 2012-2017: Financial Analyst (CFA charterholder)
    - R and Python for data analysis

- 2017-2019: Studying Mathematics and Statistics
    - Mainly using Python

- 2019 - now: Machine Learning Engineer and NLP Researcher
    - Mainly using Python for AI development
    - R and SQL for data analysis

# Why we need Data Science for AI development?

- AI is a data-driven technology

- Many AI development tasks are data science tasks
    - cleaning data
    - structuring data
    - analysing data

- It is much cheaper to feed clean data to AI models compared to using dirty data


---

# AI develoment = Data Structure + Algorithm (AI models)


---

# New level of automation

- Traditional software development heavily relies on structured data
    - e.g. relational database
    - e.g. JSON

- AI development requires a new level of automation
    - e.g. unstructured data
    - e.g. images, videos, audios, texts, etc.


---

# New level of automation

- But we still need to structure data for AI development
    - e.g. data cleaning
    - e.g. data augmentation
    - e.g. data labelling


---

# Roadmap


- Benchmarking of `duckdb`, `R-data.table` and `pandas`

- Environment setup

- Big picutre of data science for AI development

- Demos and Labs

- GNU Make for data science
