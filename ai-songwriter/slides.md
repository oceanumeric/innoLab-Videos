It's the Thursday morning

I got the plan of traveling to another city

As I need to make some extra money
```

<img class="landing-img" src="../images/michael.png">

```
When I arrived at the train station

I got the notification 

They said your train was canceled

Because they had another strike
```


<img class="landing-img" src="../images/michael.png">

```
With 40 Euros left in my pocket

I can not afford to take another ticket

So I need to borow some money from my credit card

```
I don't feel safe no more in this world

I don't die in the nuclear war

I just want to sail away to a distant shore

So I could live like a free man

# I like Bob Dylan

```
# I want you (1966)

The drunken politician leaps

Upon the street where mothers weep

And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you

And I wait for them to interrupt

Me drinkin’ from my broken cup

And ask me to

Open up the gate for you
```

# I like Bob Dylan

```
# It's all over now, baby blue (1965)

The highway is for gamblers
Better use your sense
Take what you have gathered
From coincidence

The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky too is fallin' in over you
And it's all over now, baby blue

They have a song called 'Apeman'

I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized
'Cause I'm a strict vegetarian
But with the over-population and inflation and starvation
And the crazy politicians
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an apeman

I like Bob Dylan, especially his ability of putting great
lyrics into simple tunes, which could push us to 
have some reflections with our world.

For instance, Bob dylan's song - The Times They Are a-Changin',
aims to ride upon the unvoiced sentiment of a mass public—to 
give that inchoate sentiment an anthem and give its clamour 
an outlet. 

Another example, a bob dylan's song "I Want You", 
has lyrics like this: 

The drunken politician leaps.
Upon the street where mothers weep.
And the saviors who are fast asleep, 
they wait for you. 
And I wait for them to interrupt Me 
drinkin’ from my broken cup 
And ask me to Open up the gate for you". 

This example shows how bob dylan have some 
reflections on income inequality.
 
Now generate a song for me with the same style of Bob Dylan.

# Results

```
G                    C
On a Thursday morning, I packed my bags to roam,
Em                          D
Headed to see a client, on the rails I call my own.
G                       C
But the station's buzzing, with a different kind of sound,
Em                              D
Train drivers on strike, and my plans crumble to the ground.

G                         C
Farmers block the roads, in protest they stand tall,
Em                              D
In this shifting landscape, where the powerful take a fall.
G                       C
Germany in turmoil, echoes of a different game,
Em                        D
Political dynamics shifting, in Europe's restless frame.
```

# With different chords 

```
A                    D
Thursday morning, bags in hand,
E                          A
Off to see a client, in a troubled land.
A                         D
But the station's quiet, a different sound,
E                            A
Strikers on the rails, my plans unwound.

A                       D
Farmers on the roads, in protest they stand,
E                         A
In this shifting world, where power's in demand.
A                        D
Germany's turmoil, a different game,
E                            A
Political dynamics, shifting all the same.

# Who won the contest?

- I think 'it should be me' ?
    - as ChatGPT still could not play guitar right now
    - processing the information and writing a song is not easy
    - especially processing the environment and atmosphere
